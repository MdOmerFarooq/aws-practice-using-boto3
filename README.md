# AWS using Boto3 Practice Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a collection of Python scripts I've written to practice and demonstrate my understanding of AWS services.

As I learn a new service within AWS, my goal is to interact with it programmatically using the Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python) library.

## My Goal

This project is a core part of my learning path to becoming a Cloud Engineer. By building these scripts, I'm gaining hands-on experience in both AWS resource management and automation with Python.
